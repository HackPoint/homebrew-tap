  # The release pipeline has always built an x86_64 Linux CLI; it just was not
  # offered here, so `brew install` on Linux failed with no bottle. The daemon and
  # CLI are pure cross-platform Rust (SQLite is compiled from source via rusqlite
  # `bundled`), so the same binary needs no system libraries.
  #
  # arm64 Linux is absent on purpose: the pipeline builds no such artifact yet, and
  # pointing at a URL that 404s is worse than declining to offer it.
